## ðŸ’¡How Reviews Influence Filtering (Planned Feature) ##

In future versions, the system will:
- Analyse product reviews for sentiment
- Boost relevance scores for positive reviews aligned with a user's skin type
- Penalise products with consistently negative feedback

This would involve scraping or importing review data and performing text classification or sentiment analysis using tools like NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob.
